This repository contains the following:

resizeable_image.py: Implementation here.

imagematrix.py: Implements some utility functions that will make it
easy to manipulate images.  Note that the energy function is provided
here.

removal! 

sunset_small.png and sunset_full.png: Sample images used in the unit
test suite (and also suitable for use with the GUI).
